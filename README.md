## Get Started

```sh
# Use your favorite package manager (bun, pnpm, and npm are supported)
$ pnpm install -g anyclaude

# anyclaude is a wrapper for the Claude CLI
# `openai/`, `google/`, `xai/`, and `anthropic/` are supported
$ anyclaude --model openai/gpt-5-mini
```

Switch models in the Claude UI with `/model openai/gpt-5-mini`.

### GPT-5 Support

Use --reasoning-effort (alias: -e) to control OpenAI reasoning.effort. Allowed values: minimal, low, medium, high.

```sh
anyclaude --model openai/gpt-5-mini -e high
```

Use --service-tier (alias: -t) to control OpenAI service tier. Allowed values: flex, priority.

```sh
anyclaude --model openai/gpt-5-mini -t priority
```

Note these flags may be extended to other providers in the future.

## FAQ

### What providers are supported?

See [the providers](./src/main.ts#L17) for the implementation.

- `GOOGLE_API_KEY` supports `google/*` models.
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` supports `openai/*` models.
- `XAI_API_KEY` supports `xai/*` models.
- `CURSOR_OAUTH_TOKEN` supports `cursor/*` models (OAuth authentication).

Set a custom OpenAI endpoint with `OPENAI_API_URL` to use OpenRouter

`ANTHROPIC_MODEL` and `ANTHROPIC_SMALL_MODEL` are supported with the `<provider>/` syntax.

### Cursor Support

Cursor support is built-in - no additional installation required.

Authenticate once:

```bash
anyclaude cursor-auth
```

This opens a browser window for OAuth authentication. After successful authentication, tokens are stored in `~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json`.

Then run Claude Code with Cursor:

```bash
anyclaude --model cursor/composer-2
```

### How does this work?

Claude Code has added support for customizing the Anthropic endpoint with `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`.

anyclaude spawns a simple HTTP server that translates between Anthropic's format and the [AI SDK](https://github.com/vercel/ai) format, enabling support for any [AI SDK](https://github.com/vercel/ai) provider (e.g., Google, OpenAI, etc.)
